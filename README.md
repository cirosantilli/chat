This repository has been deprecated when I saw the light and started to consolidate all my content in a few key repos.

Issues have been transferred to the following repos:

- China stuff: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues
- Linux kernel / low level: https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/issues
- Everything else: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/issues

Please open your issues on those repos instead.

Transfer was done with GitHub's newly added feature: https://help.github.com/en/articles/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository which automatically generates redirects and keeps old permalinks working. All we lose is search.

# Old README

Public chats.

Feel free to open an issue if you have anything to say to me.
